# Snapdrop

Snapdrop: local file sharing in your browser. Inspired by Apple's Airdrop.

## Snapdrop is now LimeWire

> Dear Snapdrop community,
> Snapdrop has been acquired by LimeWire, a leading file sharing platform with integrated AI tools. You can continue to share any files between devices, while benefitting from:
>
> - sharing files between devices in the same network
> - anonymous up- & downloads
> - end-to-end encryption
> - up to 40GB storage for free users
> - integrated AI tools for signed-up users

Do not visit this scum company's website. They are after your money with their trash AI.

The original Snapdrop vision (this repo) code runs on my self-hosted instance, at [drop.laurcons.ro](https://drop.laurcons.ro). Use it liberally.
